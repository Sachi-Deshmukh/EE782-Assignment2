    "### Challenges Faced During Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "For the EE782 Assignment 2, we encountered several technical obstacles related to dependency installation, hardware integration, model reliability, and API configurations. These were addressed iteratively through debugging, community resources (e.g., Stack Overflow, GitHub issues), and targeted optimizations. Below, we have outlined the key challenges, their impacts, and the solutions implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Challenge | Description | Impact | Solution |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|\n",
    "| **Dependency Installation Errors (dlib/face_recognition and PyAudio)** | On Windows with Python 3.12, `pip install dlib` failed due to missing C++ build tools (CMake/Visual Studio errors), and PyAudio required manual wheel downloads for compatibility. This blocked core libraries for face recognition and audio input. | Prevented initial setup; wasted ~2-3 hours on compilation attempts. | Installed Visual Studio Community (C++ workload) for dlib builds, but switched to pre-compiled wheels from GitHub repos (e.g., z-mahmud22 for dlib-19.24.99-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl). For PyAudio, downloaded from Christoph Gohlke's site (PyAudio-0.2.14-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl) and installed via `pip install wheel.whl`. Updated README with Windows-specific notes. |\n",
    "| **Webcam Window Hanging/Freezing** | The OpenCV webcam loop froze after a few frames due to high CPU load from `face_recognition.face_encodings()` on every frame, causing unresponsive windows and 100% CPU usage. | Disrupted real-time monitoring; made testing unreliable during Milestone 3. | Implemented frame skipping (process every 5th frame) and downsampling (resize to 1/4 resolution before encoding, scale back locations). |\n",
    "| **Face Recognition Failure** | The system failed to recognise trusted faces under different variations . | Broke Milestone 2 accuracy (target 80%); required re-testing with varied data. | Added logging in `enroll_trusted_faces()` to count encodings per photo/user. Used 10-12 diverse photos per person (frontal, varied lighting/angles).  Lowered tolerance to 0.4 for stricter matching. Verified with standalone encoding tests. |\n",
    "| **TTS File Lock Errors (WinError 32)** | During escalation, `os.remove('response.mp3')` failed because `pygame.mixer.music` held a file lock after playback, especially on rapid successive calls. | Interrupted TTS flow; caused crashes in multi-response scenarios. | Explicitly called `pygame.mixer.music.unload()` post-playback. Added retry loop with some (up to 3 attempts). |\n",
    "| **Gmail SMTP Authentication Failure (535 5.7.8 BadCredentials)** | Email alerts at level 3 failed due to deprecated \"less secure app access\" in Gmail (post-2025 policy), blocking SMTP login with regular password. | Prevented stretch goal completion; no notifications during demos. | Enabled 2FA and generated App Passwords via Google Account Security > App passwords. Updated `server.login()` with the 16-char token. Added SMTP-specific error handling in `send_alert()`. Tested with standalone script; configured via `alert_settings.json`. |\n",

    "2. The face recognition also works with high accuracy distinguishing between the trusted as well as untrusted faces. We have also tested the detection under different light conditions and it recognized the trusted face correctly even in different settings, giving no false negatives.\n",
    "3. In case the guard encounters an intruder, the escalation works perfectly with an alert mail sent to the recipient email address mentioned in the `alert_settings.json` file in case the escalation goes above level 3.\n",
    "4. In case the intruder, during escalation mentions he is a friend or an intruder i.e., in case the keywords `friend` or `owner` are used then escaltion stops smoothly. Hence, keyword spotting also works"
