As a part of Milestone-4 we have tried to do following things:
1. After 3 levels of escalation are crossed and alert mail is said to the owner with an image of the intruder captured by the webcam.
2. Like a keyword spotter in case the intruder says that he is a friend or owner i.e., if the keywords "owner" or "friends" are detected the escalation will be stopped and the guard will welcome the guest.
3. For a frame captured by the webcam a box appears around the face detected with the name of the detected person as per the folder name in the "trusted faces" folder and unknown id in case of an intruder. The box is green for trusted face and red otherwise.
