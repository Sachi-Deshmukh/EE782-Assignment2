As a part of Milestone-3 we have tried to do the following things:

- Integrated a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to generate dynamic dialogue responses at three escalation levels.  
- Added **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** functionality using `gTTS` and `pygame` for natural spoken interaction.  
- Implemented **three-stage escalation** — Level 1: polite query (“Who are you?”), Level 2: firm warning (“Please leave”), Level 3: stern alert or alarm.  
- Linked **speech recognition**, **face detection**, and **LLM dialogue** into one unified system flow.  
- Tested full functionality through multiple interaction scenarios to ensure **smooth transitions** and **creative escalation**.
